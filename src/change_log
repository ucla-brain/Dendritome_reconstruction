- use nlohman_json library 3.5.0. previous build used version 3.0.1, please
  rebuild with utils script: python build_ext_libraries.py nlohman_json
  the build requires cmake >= 3.8. build_ext_libraries.py will attempt to
  generate cmake bin location (/usr/local/cmake-3.8.2/bin/cmake). if this
  path does not exist, system default cmake command is used. if the system
  default is < 3.8 the build will not succeed    03/19/2019
- save a single __image_info__.json under image root,
  instead of one __pyr_level_nn__.json under each pyramid folder  03/27/2019
- imaris file read and general hdf5 utility functions    03/27/2019
  only *FusionStitcher.ims files will be read. unstitched tiles are ignored
- reverse dimension order from xyz(ct) to (tc)zyx   03/27/2019
  data volumes returned from MImage have axes order zyx
- automatic z scaling handling in reading operation  03/27/2019
- properly handle python object returns from MImage instances  03/27/2019
- expose additional c++ functions in python binding    03/27/2019
  (only listing selected python binding functions, see pymcp3d.pyx for full
   changes. pymcp3d.pyx contains the entire python binding API)
   MImage:
       SaveImageInfo(self):
           save image info file. such saved file saves time in ReadChannelInfo call
       WriteImagePyramids(self, int start_parent_level,
                          int end_parent_level=999,
                          bool multi_threading=False,
                          bool save_image_info=True,
                          int write_format=UNKNOWN_FORMAT):
           this function creates image pyramids.
           first level of input is start_parent_level
           runs locally, not recommended for large dataset
       xyz_dims(self, int pyr_level=0):
           xyz dimensions of image at given level
       dims(self, int pyr_level=0)
       n_pyr_infos(self):
           number of image levels available
- changed function signatures (only listing selected differences
                               in python binding)    03/27/2019
   MImage:
       ReadChannelInfo(self, string img_root_dir, bool gather_all_channels=True)
       SelectView(self, MImageBlock global_view, int rl=0,
                  bool interpret_view_as_local=False, int voxel_type=UNKNOWN):
       ReadChannelData(self, bool black_background=True, const string& mode=b"verbose")
       selected_view(self)
       loaded_view(self)
- changed function behavior (only listing selected differences
                             in python binding)      03/27/2019
  MImage:
      Data(): if only 1 volume of data (aka single channel) is read,
              the function no longer returns length 1 list but the array directly

- rebuild hdf5 as serial library. this is required for non-MPI lean build we
  need for distribution    03/29/2019
- update README.md     03/29/2019
- restructure project folder
  src: all c++ source code
  python: pure python code
  test_data: data used by tests
  bin: executable installation directory
  lib: library installation directory
       on linux the library run time path is set with $ORIGIN

- fix error in 3rd party library builds in fix_wrapper branch   5/31/2019
    - python build_ext_libraries.py all will now only build serial version of hdf5
    - correct file path issue in boost build

- build app2, resample swc from vaa3d in app2_fix_wrapper branch 5/31/2019

- split in memory insances of MImage into MImageMemory in app2_fix_wrapper
  branch 6/14/2019

- remove image_info_ as member of MImageView. pass const ref of MImageInfo when
  needed in app2_fix_wrapper branch 6/14/2019

- classes MChannelInfo and MImageInfo

- remove channel and time selection from MImageBlock

- merge app2_fix_wrapper and main branch
  add multi-channel support to image library
  functions including ReadImageInfo, SelectView receive an additional channel
  argument. for an image with channel directories ["ch1", "ch2", "ch3"], to
  read channel info for directory "ch3", the channel argument should equal to 2
  7/12/2019

- class MChannelPyrSlices
  MChannelPyrInfo has a member MChannelPyrSlices instance

- class MOmeTiffFormat

- build opencv in mcp3d/src/3rd_party  08/08/2019

- relax requirement of pyramid ratio on z axis

- class MVolumeLayout. change constructor of MImage and MImageInfo.
  change API of MImage::ReadImageInfo     03/27/2020
